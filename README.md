## A gym for Toronto
#### Project idea and background
My project is based around the question, in which neighbourhood in Toronto one would want to open a new gym. The subject targets individual business people, who would like to own their own company and decided to establish a sports venue and also gym chains, which want to open a new venue in a neighbourhood without a gym.  
#### Data
For this project, I will use, inter alia, data from a Wikipedia page, which presents a list of all postal codes with their boroughs and neighbourhoods. Please find a link here below:

Additionally, for the purpose of locating the different postcode areas, I will use the gespatial data of Toronto provided on the Coursera website, which was used in the previous segmentation and clustering assignment. 
Finally, to find out which neighbourhood best fits our purpose, I will use Foursquare data for the different neighbourhoods to see which venues correlate with the existence of a gym in an area.
